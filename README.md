## Solving Rush Hour at Place Vanier 
I am a first year student at UBC, and I'm loving it. But there is always a line at the Place Vanier Food Hall. As a computer science student, I thought of a website to solve this problem. I will post a poster with a qr code. When stuck in line, people will scan said code and it will record the time on the website. Then, others can look at the website and see a graph of when it is the most busy. Allowing people to adjust their schedule accordingly.

## Development
```bash
$ # Clone the sources
$ git clone https://github.com/justindhillon/ubcevents
$
$ # Run the application
$ cd ubcevents && npm run dev
$
$ # Start the application at https://localhost:3000.
```
