# Solving Rush Hour at Place Vanier 
I go to ubc, and I love it. But there is a problem. 
<br><br>
So people complain about the lines for food halls during rush periods, but nobody knows when itâ€™s busy and get stuck in the lines 
<br><br>
So I will post a poster, people will scan a qr code when they are stuck in line and it will record the time 
<br><br>
Then people can go on the website and see a graph of when it is super busy, then adjust their schedule accordingly 
<br><br>
The project will use next.js, chartjs, postgress, and is hosted on vercel.
<br><br>
Look at progress here:
